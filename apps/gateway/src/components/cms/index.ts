 * This file allows you to:

 * 2. Add app-specific components
 * 3. Override shared components if needed

// Re-export the shared components map
export { components } from "@repo/cms";

// You can also extend with app-specific components:
// import { components as sharedComponents } from "@repo/cms";
// import { CustomComponent } from "./CustomComponent";
//
// export const components = {
//   ...sharedComponents,
//   custom_component: CustomComponent,
// };
