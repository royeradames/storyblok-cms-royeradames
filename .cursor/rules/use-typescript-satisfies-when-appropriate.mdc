# Use TypeScript `satisfies` When Appropriate

Use the `satisfies` operator when you want to verify that a value matches a required type while keeping precise inferred literal types.

- Prefer `const value = {...} satisfies SomeType` for static config objects, maps, and option definitions.
- Use `satisfies` to catch missing keys, extra invalid fields, and incompatible value types at compile time.
- Keep inference narrow for downstream usage instead of forcing broad annotation with `: SomeType`.
- Use type annotations (`: SomeType`) when you intentionally want type widening or explicit API boundaries.

Avoid:
- Replacing every annotation with `satisfies` by default.
- Using `as` assertions where `satisfies` can provide safer verification.

Use `satisfies` when verification + inference preservation is the goal.
