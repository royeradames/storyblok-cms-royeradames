# Storyblok CMS Sync Requirement

When a task changes Storyblok-related code, schema, seed definitions, mappings, or Storyblok component behavior, the agent must also update the CMS in the same task.

- Do not stop after code edits only.
- Run the appropriate Storyblok update command(s) before finishing.
- Verify the update command succeeded and report result.

Use this in combination with scope rules:

- Prefer targeted CMS/component updates for narrow changes.
- Run full CMS update only when changes are global/foundation-level.

Default expectation: no manual reminder is needed; if Storyblok code changed, CMS sync is required.
