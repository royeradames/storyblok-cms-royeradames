# Extract Nested Object Types

When a TypeScript type includes nested object literals, prefer moving those nested shapes into their own named types.

- Extract repeated or meaningful nested object shapes into `type` aliases.
- Reference extracted types from parent types instead of inline nested literals.
- Name extracted types by domain meaning and role.
- Reuse extracted types across props, API models, and utility signatures when applicable.

Avoid:
- Deep inline nested object literals that are hard to scan or reuse.
- Duplicating the same nested shape across multiple parent types.

Use inline nested object literals only when the shape is truly one-off and trivial.
