# Storyblok Update Scope

Default behavior: only update Storyblok components that were actually changed by the current work.

- Do not run full `bun run storyblok:seed` by default.
- First identify changed component definitions/schema fields related to the current task.
- Prefer targeted push/update flow for those components only.
- If current changes are global by nature, then run full update.

Treat as **global change** (full update allowed) when changes affect shared foundations, for example:

- `styles_breakpoint_options` schema shape used across most components
- shared seed generation/push behavior
- broad shared maps/types that impact many Storyblok fields/components

For narrow changes (e.g. one component option/text/style), update only that component (and directly dependent ones if needed).
