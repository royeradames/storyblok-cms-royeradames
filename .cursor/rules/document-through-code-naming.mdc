# Document Through Code Naming

Prefer self-documenting code by expressing intent through function, variable, and type names.

- Name functions by behavior and outcome, not implementation detail.
- Name variables by meaning and role in the domain, not temporary mechanics.
- Use abstraction-revealing names that communicate "why" and "what" at a glance.
- Keep naming consistent with surrounding domain terms.

Avoid:
- Generic names like `data`, `value`, `item`, `temp`, or `handler` when a specific name is possible.
- Misleading names that hide side effects or business intent.
- Abbreviations unless they are standard and unambiguous in the codebase.

Prefer code readability through naming first; add comments only when naming and structure cannot fully express intent.
