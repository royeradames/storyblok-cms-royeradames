# Early Guards Pattern

Use early guard clauses to handle invalid, empty, or exceptional states first.

- Return early for error or edge cases before main logic.
- Keep the primary success path at base indentation.
- Prefer multiple small guards over deep nested `if/else` blocks.
- Put the cheapest and most decisive checks first.

Avoid:
- Wrapping the full function body in a top-level `if` when an early return is possible.
- Long `else if` chains when guard returns can flatten control flow.

Use this pattern in components, hooks, utilities, and server handlers when it improves readability.
