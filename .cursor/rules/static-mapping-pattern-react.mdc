# Static Mapping Pattern (React)

When component behavior is a static mapping from a finite key union (for example, `'state' | 'country' | 'time'`) to config objects:

1. Use a typed module-level `Record<KeyUnion, Config>`.
2. Precompute static option arrays at module scope if they do not depend on props/state.
3. In component render, resolve via a single lookup:
   `const config = CONFIG_BY_KEY[key]`.

Avoid:
- Nested ternaries for 3+ branches.
- IIFE + `switch` for pure data mapping.

Use `switch` only when each branch contains non-trivial procedural logic.
